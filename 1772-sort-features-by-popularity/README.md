<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-features-by-popularity/">1772. Sort Features by Popularity</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given a string array <code>features</code> where <code>features[i]</code> is a single word that represents the name of a feature of the latest product you are working on. You have made a survey where users have reported which features they like. You are given a string array <code>responses</code>, where each <code>responses[i]</code> is a string containing space-separated words.</p>

<p>The <strong>popularity</strong> of a feature is the number of <code>responses[i]</code> that contain the feature. You want to sort the features in non-increasing order by their popularity. If two features have the same popularity, order them by their original index in <code>features</code>. Notice that one response could contain the same feature multiple times; this feature is only counted once in its popularity.</p>

<p>Return <em>the features in sorted order.</em></p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> features = ["cooler","lock","touch"], responses = ["i like cooler cooler","lock touch cool","locker like touch"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["touch","cooler","lock"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> appearances("cooler") = 1, appearances("lock") = 1, appearances("touch") = 2. Since "cooler" and "lock" both had 1 appearance, "cooler" comes first because "cooler" came first in the features array.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> features = ["a","aa","b","c"], responses = ["a","a aa","a a a a a","b a"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["a","aa","b","c"]
</pre>
