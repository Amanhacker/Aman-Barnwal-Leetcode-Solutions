<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/">692. Top K Frequent Words</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given an array of strings <code>words</code> and an integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the </em><code>k</code><em> most frequent strings</em>.</p>

<p>Return the answer <strong>sorted</strong> by <strong>the frequency</strong> from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their <strong>lexicographical order</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> ["i","love"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> ["the","is","sunny","day"]

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 10</code></li>
	<li><code>words[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
	<li><code>k</code> is in the range <code>[1, The number of <strong>unique</strong> words[i]]</code></li>
</ul>
